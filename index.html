        <p>
          I am Monirul Islam Fahad. I was born in Noakhali, Bangladesh. I spend
          my whole childhood there. Now I am 22 years old. I think this is the
          time of worring about my future. I have to do something for my better
          future. So, I came to Dhaka to my cousin who is a professional web
          developer. I came to him to learn web developing. He suggested me a
          course organized by Jhankar Mahbub. I enrolled the course. Now I am
          learning from him. This site is a practice part of his course.

            They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remote web
            developer. I made their website and showed it to them. They liked
            it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming
            Hero.
